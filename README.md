My personal portfolio webpage

## Summary
A portfolio is a necessary construction for a web developer. Whether it's a potential employer, or to other professionals, a web developer is best served by having a website dedicated to displaying their best work. This webpage is meant to be my solution to this basic requirement; it is my own portfolio. It's the site where I'll display my best work as I progress in the subject of web development.

## Features

> **Displaying my current work!**
>
>
> * The page starts with a large header, with buttons to navigate around the page/site.
 >
> * There is an "about me" section where potential employers may see a relatively recent photo of myself.
>
> * The webpage contains a rough portfolio section which I will be periodically updating to display weekly challenges. I currently have just one up, but will put up more in the near future.
>
> * The "contact" currently has only a hyperlink to my linkedin profile.
>
> * The index.html has been structured using semantic html elements.
>
> * The CSS has been arranged such that the header is constructed using a CSS Grid.
>
> * I switched to using a flexbox element for the main element of the html page, but am currently rethinking this approach. 
>
> *Although the responsiveness currently works for portrait mode, it still needs improvement, and some landscape mode layouts aren't properly 
> aligned.
